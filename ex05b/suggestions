1) The diagrams visual representation could be fixed more so that each line curves less and is easier to understand
2) Each table could use more attributes to better define their entity
  ex. Customer table should seperate customer name into first and last name as well as break up address so that each entry 
        will not contain too much information that cannot be easily changed
      Movies and Games should include information about pricing and stock quantitiess
      Transactions need to have customer information, shipping information, order costs and any sort of discount rates
      Employees should contain similar changes as the customer table
3) The primary keys for Location can be the kiosk number, customer can be phone number
